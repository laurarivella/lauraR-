## About me

I am a Political Scientist specialized in Security Studies.
After grad school I started working as an Intelligence Analyst in the pharmaceutical field. 
Soon after starting my job, I began to take an interest in ways to improve the collection and analysis of data, and that led me to programming.
With a couple of years of on the job experience I began to wonder to which extent I could take programming and what its applications to my field of studies were.
This led me to enroll in an Cybersecurity program at the University of Essex online.
