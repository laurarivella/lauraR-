## Discussion forum 1

To keep exploring the theme of Seminar 1 on Shell Global, in this first Discussion forum I expanded on the reasons to invest in cybersecurity in the energy sector, choosing ENI as a company to analyze. ENI is an Italian energy company with a worldwide footprint.

### Intro post 

Network and information systems have been recognized as playing a vital role in society by supporting key sectors such as energy. (EU Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2019) ENI is an example of a company operating in the oil and gas industry in sixty-six countries worldwide. The nature of its business covers the whole energy lifecycle from extraction, to end user delivery. (ENI, 2019)

Investing in cybersecurity in the energy sector is vital to ensure business continuity at every organizational level. Preventing attacks on control systems is the main focus in this industry since it relies on these systems to manage refining operations at plant sites, to monitor and control pipelines remotely, and to support the business logistic chain. (Cardenas, 2019) Being a service provider also means storing customers’ data. Data from a 2019 survey show that six out of ten of large firms have identified breaches. (Government of the UK, 2019)

In addition to the financial cost associated with the breach itself, consequent loss of reputation is harder to quantify. (Poneman Institute, 2018)
ENI is a good example of strategic positioning and investment in cybersecurity. It has closely monitored political and legal developments, echoing policy recommendations, mainly European law and G7 meetings. (Comes, 2019)

### Summary post 

Based on peer responses and what we covered in the first three units, there are great points to address.

Firstly, addressing peer contributions and expanding on the original post, the energy sector is indeed part of what is considered critical infrastructure. Since networks and information systems play a vital role in society by supporting key sectors such as energy, finance, transport and health, a lack of vigilance affects society at large. (EU Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2019)

Arguably, there is a shared responsibility on both privately owned companies and governments to see that effective measures and resiliency are built into critical infrastructure. As we have discussed in Seminar one on Shell Global, problems may arise from something as deceivingly simple as unsynchronised software patching in different plants.

I agree that compliance with regulation does not necessarily mean adequate levels of security, having also experienced it in my work in a highly regulated sector. A great example is firewalls: a company may choose an expensive firewall to check it off an auditor’s list, but that does not necessarily make it the most adequate choice. (Anderson, 2008)

An interesting point about geopolitical motivations for attacks in the sector has been raised. The energy sector has always been geopolitically relevant as it is literally the fuel of a country’s economy and it is tied to its survival. This makes it a particularly tempting geopolitical and geoeconomic target. (Blackwill & Harris, 2016) Very recent examples of this being the Nord Stream 2 pipeline raising tensions between Europe, Russia and the U.S. (New York Times, 2020) and the latest acquisition by Chevron (Reed, 2020), which is bound to affect tensions in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East.
It is vital to highlight the layers of interconnectedness that affect current information systems. As we have explored in these first three units, a simple software bug can have much greater consequences than being just another hack in a statistic.
