## Discussion forum  

As an integral part of our studies, we are encouraged to participate in structured peer debates in the form of a moderated discussion forum on a relevant topic.
In the third and final week of a debate cycle, a summary post provides ample material to reflect on my own contribution and my peer's contribution. 
It is a great chance to delve deeper into topics and questions left unanswered. 

Topics include:
* Cybersecurity in clinical infrastructure and the energy sector
* Data privacy laws and regulations
* Threat analysis
* Threat mitigation
