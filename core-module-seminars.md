## Seminar 1 - 02/10/2020 - Shell Global Case Study (Security Threats)

We have looked at Shell Global and reviewed the security considerations for a company that size with branches across various continents. 

Task: Investigate the various security concerns this company has had, and might have in the future.

ICS architecture 
Industrial control system 
Categories of vulnerabilities are in scope and we are interested in:
	• Remote Code Execution
	• SQL injection vulnerabilities
	• Authentication or authorization flaws
	• Server-side code execution bugs
	• Encryption vulnerabilities

Task: Provide exemplars of how these concerns have been or can be dealt with by the company.  

2010 Data breach related to shell's activity in Nigeria.
Contact details of more than 170,000 Royal Dutch Shell employees and contractors have become public after a group claiming to be Shell staff concerned about the oil company's activities e-mailed them to eco and corporate activists.

Based on this example, what issues do you foresee as a Cyber Security professional if employed by multinational companies? How does this compare with issues faced by small and medium-sized companies? A unified approach to security.

2015 Shell Works with Yokogawa and Cisco on a Unified Cybersecurity Approach
The three companies will implement the joint SecurePlant initiative at about 50 Shell plants over the next three years to standardize cybersecurity measures for the global oil producer. Shell Oil Company has partnered with Cisco and Yokogawa Electric Corporation to increase its cybersecurity at plants around the world in an attempt to insulate themselves from “hackers intent on tampering with physical infrastructure.”
Shell plans on launching its comprehensive security program, SecurePlant system, at fifty locations around the world over the next three years. The system “is designed to eliminate the vulnerabilities that often arise when equipment, software and patches vary by location. By protecting plants with a program from a single team of vendors, Shell hopes to standardize security throughout its system and gain the ability to monitor threats in real time.”

	• Standardization to eliminate vulnerabilities arising when equipment, software and patches vary by location
	• Real time monitoring
	• Preventing physical infrastructure tampering
